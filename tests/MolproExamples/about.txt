The command {FCI;DUMP} at the end of a Molpro input file results in the one and two-electron integral file being produced (FCIDUMP) with frozen cores automatically chosen. {FCI;CORE;DUMP} does not freeze any orbital while {FCI;CORE,2,2;DUMP} freezes the first two orbitals of the first two symmetries.

When running molpro, the option -d PATH can be used to create the FCIDUMP file in PATH.  

Given a Molpro output file then 

./MolproToMcci.sh outputfile 

will produce an example mcci.in file for a ground-state calculation where the reference configuration corresponds to the Molpro Hartree-Fock result.  
This file can then be tailored for a required calculation.


Two example folders with reference input and output from a one processor calculation are provided. One example folder for a MCCIPT2 calculation has 
been added.
